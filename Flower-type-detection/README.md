# Week 4 - Machine Learning Notes 🧠📊

This repository contains notes and code from **Week 4 of a Machine Learning course** (dated October 30), structured as a Jupyter Notebook. The notebook walks through key concepts and hands-on coding exercises in supervised learning, with a focus on practical model development and evaluation using Python.

## 📘 Contents

- Supervised Learning Overview  
- Data Preprocessing Techniques  
- Classification vs Regression  
- Model Selection and Training  
- Cross-Validation & Evaluation Metrics  
- Hands-on practice with `scikit-learn`  
- Code examples and inline explanations

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- Python 3.x  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Libraries:
  - `numpy`
  - `pandas`
  - `scikit-learn`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `seaborn`

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone the repository or download the `.ipynb` file.
2. Open the notebook using Jupyter Notebook or VS Code with Python/Jupyter extension.
3. Ensure you have the required libraries installed:

bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
Run the cells in order for a complete walkthrough.

## 📈 Learning Objectives
By the end of this notebook, you should be able to:

Understand the key components of supervised learning workflows.

Train and evaluate ML models on sample datasets.

Apply techniques like normalization and cross-validation.

Interpret model accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification reports.

##📎 Notes
These materials are part of an academic or training session.

Data used is likely synthetic or from sample datasets provided by sklearn.
