# 🧠 Deep Learning - Week 9: Deep Belief Networks (DBN)  

This repository contains materials and implementations from **Week 9** of the Deep Learning course, focusing on **Deep Belief Networks (DBN)**. The notebooks and documents explore DBN concepts, architecture, training methods, and applications.

## 📌 Project Overview  

### **What is a Deep Belief Network (DBN)?**  
A **Deep Belief Network (DBN)** is a **probabilistic generative model** introduced by **Geoffrey Hinton in 2006**. DBNs consist of **stacked Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs)** and can perform **non-linear dimensionality reduction, classification, and feature extraction**.  

### **Topics Covered in This Repository**  
✔ Introduction to **Deep Belief Networks** (DBN)  
✔ DBN **architecture** and how it differs from Feedforward Neural Networks  
✔ **RBMs (Restricted Boltzmann Machines)** and their role in DBNs  
✔ **Training a DBN** using **Greedy Layer-Wise Pretraining** and **Contrastive Divergence (CD)**  
✔ Applications of DBNs in **image generation, classification, and recommendation systems**  
✔ Experimentation with **MNIST dataset**
