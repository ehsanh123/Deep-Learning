# 🌀 Alice in Wonderland Language Model  

This project trains a **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)** to generate text in the style of *Alice in Wonderland*, based on a given prompt. The model learns to predict and structure words sequentially, mimicking the whimsical and surreal tone of Lewis Carroll’s writing.

## 📌 Project Overview  

The main objective is to train an **RNN-based language model** to generate coherent and stylistic text. The project serves as a great tutorial on how **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) work**, particularly in handling sequential data and language modeling.

### **Notebooks Included**  

- `deeplearning_week7.ipynb` - Building the language model and structuring words in sequence.  
- `deeplearning_week7_1.ipynb` - Training the model using an RNN-based architecture.  
- `deeplearning_week7_2.ipynb` - Generating text based on prompts in the style of *Alice in Wonderland*.  

## 🛠️ Requirements  

Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:
