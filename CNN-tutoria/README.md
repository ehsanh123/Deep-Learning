Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) Project
This repository contains an implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, which uses a variety of techniques such as data augmentation, hyperparameter tuning, and deep learning model evaluation to classify images. It is built using Python, Keras, and TensorFlow.

Overview
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a powerful class of deep learning algorithms that have proven to be highly effective in tasks such as image recognition, object detection, and medical imaging. This project demonstrates how CNNs can be applied to image classification tasks, with a focus on using CNN architectures to classify images, along with applying various techniques to improve model accuracy.

Key Features
Data Augmentation: Techniques such as cropping, flipping, rotation, and contrast adjustments are used to augment the dataset and improve model performance.

Hyperparameter Tuning: The model includes configurable hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, momentum, and dropout to optimize performance.

CNN Architecture: The model architecture includes convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers for classification.

Evaluation: The model performance is evaluated using accuracy metrics, and various modifications to the CNN architecture can be made to explore different results.
